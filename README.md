    Our firm, DataBusters, has been tasked with structuring the database for the new 
    Tokyo rail system app that citizens and visitors can use to plan their public 
    transportation needs throughout the city of Tokyo. Annually the entire system 
    transports 1 million people. There are 180 stations spread across 9 different 
    lines, with a total of 500 trains in the entire rail system. Currently, there 
    are 40 licensed train operators on staff with the Tokyo Metro. Our responsibility 
    is to make sure the database is structured properly so users of the app can plan 
    their trips efficiently and accurately according to the information the app supplies.
